# 🏆 Day 30: The Grand Finale - SQL Interview Prep & Review

## 🎯 Objective
Congratulations on reaching Day 30! Today’s focus shifts from hands-on case studies to **technical interview mastery**. 
This folder contains curated resources to bridge the gap between writing queries and explaining technical concepts to hiring managers.

---

## 📚 Study Resources Included
Today's repository includes two comprehensive guides for interview preparation:

1. **Top_50_SQL_Interview_Questions.pdf**: A deep dive into frequently asked questions ranging from basic syntax to complex database design.
2. **Top_SQL_Technical_Interview_Questions.pdf**: Focuses on "Whiteboard" style problems, optimization techniques, and theoretical concepts.

---

## 🗝️ Key Topics Mastered in this Challenge
Over the last 30 days, I have built a solid foundation in:
* **DDL/DML:** Creating, updating, and managing database structures.
* **Joins & Subqueries:** Extracting data from complex, relational schemas.
* **Window Functions:** Solving "Top N" problems using `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()`.
* **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Writing clean, readable, and modular SQL code.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling NULLs, string manipulation, and date formatting.

## 🧠 Interview Focus Areas
As part of today's final review, I am focusing on:
- **Optimization:** Understanding Indexes and Execution Plans.
- **ACID Properties:** Explaining how transactions work.
- **Normalization vs. Denormalization:** When to use each for performance.
- **Practical Problem Solving:** Live coding of complex aggregations.

### 🏁 Final Reflections
The **30-Day SQL Challenge** is officially complete! This repository serves as a roadmap of my progress from basic queries to advanced data analysis.

**Next Steps:** Starting a new project on [insert your next goal here, e.g., Python for Data Science].# 🏆 Day 30: The Grand Finale - SQL Interview Prep & Review
