# 🛠️ Days 11 - 13: The Logic & Transformation Phase

This week, I moved from being a "Data Fetcher" to a "Data Transformer." I learned how to make the database do the heavy lifting—calculating values on the fly and making decisions within the query itself.

## 💡 The Journey: Adding Intelligence to Queries

### 🧠 Day 11: The CASE Statement (If/Then Logic)
This was a game-changer. I learned how to create new categories based on data values. 
* **The "Aha!" moment:** Realizing I could label sales as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' without changing the original table.
* **The Win:** Writing a query that automatically flagged "Low Stock" items for the inventory team.

### 🔢 Day 12: Advanced Math & String Functions
SQL isn't just for numbers! I spent today cleaning up messy text and doing more complex math.
* **Text Tricks:** Mastering `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTRING()`, and `TRIM()` to fix messy names and product codes.
* **Math Mastery:** Using `ROUND()` and `FLOOR()` to make financial reports look professional instead of having 10 decimal places.

### 📅 Day 13: Working with Dates (Time Travel)
Date functions can be a headache, but they are the most important part of business analysis. 
* **The Struggle:** Realizing every SQL flavor (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) handles dates slightly differently!
* **Key Skills:** Extracting the Year, Month, or Day from a timestamp and calculating the difference between two dates (e.g., "How many days did it take to ship this order?").

## 🛠️ Skills I’ve Sharpened
* **Conditional Logic:** Using `CASE WHEN` to build custom reports for different departments.
* **Data Formatting:** Understanding that data is only useful if it’s readable (Dates, Currency, and Clean Names).
* **Efficiency:** Learning that calculating things in SQL is often much faster than doing it in Excel after exporting.

## 📈 Weekly Reflection
**Status:** My queries are starting to look like actual "programs."
**Current Mood:** 😎 Feeling like a data architect. 
**Looking Forward:** Getting ready for **Subqueries and CTEs**—the big leagues!
