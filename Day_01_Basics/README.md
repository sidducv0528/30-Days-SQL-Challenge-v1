# 🌱 Days 1 - 6: SQL Fundamentals & Core Syntax

This first week was dedicated to mastering the building blocks of Relational Databases. 
I focused on moving beyond simple commands to understanding how to retrieve and filter data accurately.

## 📚 What I Covered

### 🔹 Day 1: Introduction to Databases & DDL
- Understanding Tables, Rows, and Columns.
- Practicing **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.
- Setting up my first database schema.

### 🔹 Day 2: The Mighty SELECT Statement
- Fetching specific data using `SELECT` and `FROM`.
- Using `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates.
- Aliasing columns for cleaner output reporting.

### 🔹 Day 3: Filtering with WHERE
- Mastering logical operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IN`, and `BETWEEN`.
- Using **Wildcards** (`LIKE %`) to search for text patterns.

### 🔹 Day 4: Sorting & Limiting
- Organizing results using `ORDER BY` (ASC/DESC).
- Managing large datasets with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to improve query performance.

### 🔹 Day 5: Basic Aggregate Functions
- Introduction to "Math in SQL": `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
- Understanding how to get high-level snapshots of data.

### 🔹 Day 6: Grouping Data
- Mastering `GROUP BY` to categorize information.
- Using `HAVING` to filter aggregated results (and learning why `WHERE` doesn't work on totals!).

## 🛠️ Key Takeaways
* **Accuracy over Speed:** Learning that the order of execution (FROM -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> SELECT) is different from how we write it.
* **Code Cleanliness:** Writing keywords in **UPPERCASE** and using indentation to make queries readable for others.
